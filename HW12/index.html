The whole family loves her very much. She is an affectionate and very beautiful cat. We affectionately call her Busya.</li>					<li>Businka has already survived 2 wars in Ukraine, and several moves from one city to another. All the troubles and joys that we had in the family, she was always with us.</li>					<li>Busya is the mother of nine kittens.</li>					<li>At the moment my pussycat doesn`t live with me. When the war began in 2022, my family and I were not in Ukraine at that time. The cat stayed there with our grandparents. Me and my family miss her very much. I really hope that we will be able to return soon and take her back to us.</li>			    </ul>			 </div>	 		</body>		<footer>			<dl>				<dt>Additional photos of her can be viewed on the Gallery page.</dt>				<a href="pages/contact.html" target="_blank">Contact</a>				<dt>On the page "Contacts" you can see where she lives.</dt>				<a href="pages/gallery.html" target="_blank">Gallery</a>			</dl>			</footer>	</html>
