<h3>Personal life</h3>

<p>In 1987 Johnson married Allegra Mostyn-Owen. The marriage lasted less than a year. It was dissolved in 1993.
He married the barrister Marina Wheeler later the same year. Wheeler is the daughter of journalist and broadcaster 
Sir Charles Wheeler and his Sikh Indian wife, Dip Singh.
The Wheeler and Johnson families have known each other for many years. 
Marina Wheeler was at the European School in Brussels at the same time as Boris Johnson. 
They have two sons—Theodore Apollo (born 1999) and Milo Arthur (born 1995)—and two daughters—Lara Lettice (born 1993) and Cassia Peaches (born 1997).
In 2016 Johnson renounced his American citizenship. He was American because he was born in New York. 
In 2018, Johnson and Wheeler announced their separation and soon divorced in 2020. 
He later developed a relationship with Carrie Symonds around the same time he separated from Wheeler. 
They became engaged in late 2019. Their first son was born on 29 April 2020 in London. 
His name is Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. Symonds and Johnson got married in May 2021.
They had their second child, a daughter, on 9 December 2021. Her name is Romy Iris Charlotte Johnson.</p>

<h3>Political career</h3>
<img id="politic" src="picture/politic.jpg" alt="Boris Johnson Politic">
<p>Johnson ran for MP of Clwyd South in the 1997 general election. He lost the election. In 2001, he was elected MP for Henley. 
He replaced Michael Heseltine. In 2004 he became Shadow Minister for the Arts after Nick Hawkins (the Shadow Home Affairs Spokesman) resigned. 
Johnson was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party from November 2003. He put an emphasis on campaigning.
Johnson was sacked from these high-profile posts in November 2004. He was accused of lying to Michael Howard about a four-year extramarital affair with 
Petronella Wyatt, The Spectator's New York correspondent and former deputy editor. Johnson said the allegations were not true. 
He said they were "an inverted pyramid of piffle". However, Howard sacked Johnson because he believed press reports showed Johnson had lied, and not because 
of the affair itself.
The new Conservative Leader David Cameron made him Shadow Minister for Higher Education on 9 December 2005. 
Johnson resigned as editor of The Spectator soon after this. On 2 April 2006 the News of the World said that Johnson 
had had another extramarital affair. They said the affair was with journalist Anna Fazackerley from theTimes Higher Education Supplement. 
A video shows him coming out her flat and waving to her in a taxi. In a speech at the University of Exeter concerning student finance, Johson allegedly
made funny remarks about his gratitude to the audience for not "raising other issues" during the talk. 
This may have been a reference to the allegations about the second affair. 
A report in The Times said that Cameron saw the possible affair as a private matter. He said that Johnson would not lose his job over it.</p>

<h4>Brexit</h4>
<img src="picture/brexit.jpg" alt="Boris Johnson Brexit">
<p>In February 2016, Johnson supported Vote Leave for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016.
After Johnson said he wanted to leave the European Union, Brexit approval dropped nearly 2% to its lowest level since March 2009.
On 22 June 2016, Johnson said that 23 June could be "Britain's independence day" in a televised debate in front of a 6000-member audience at Wembley Arena.
David Cameron, British Prime Minister at the time, talked about Johnson's claim. He said: "the idea that our country isn't independent is nonsense. 
This whole debate demonstrates our sovereignty.
David Cameron resigned as Prime Minister after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. 
Johnson was the favourite to be the new Prime Minister.
However, Johnson announced he would not stand in the Conservative leadership election.</p>
